This project explores patterns in life insurance claim data to understand:  
**What are the key factors that contribute to early death?**

By combining storytelling and data exploration, I analyzed how health conditions, lifestyle choices, and family history impact the age at which individuals pass away — which is at the core of life insurance claims.

This project started with a simple curiosity:
> “What’s really behind the growing number of life insurance claims?”

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Explore the age distribution of life insurance claimants
- Analyze the impact of lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, drug use) on age at death
- Examine whether family medical history contributes to early mortality
- Build a simple regression model to identify which features most significantly affect life expectancy

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle:  
📎 [Individual Age of Death and Related Factors – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joannpineda/individual-age-of-death-and-related-factors/data)

Each row represents a **confirmed life insurance claim** (i.e., the individual has passed away).  
Columns include:
- Demographics: age, gender, weight, height, blood pressure
- Lifestyle: smoking, drinking, drug use, addiction
- Health: diabetes, heart disease, cholesterol levels, immune deficiency
- Family history: cancer, heart disease, cholesterol issues

The dataset was slightly modified and stored in the `/data/` folder as:
